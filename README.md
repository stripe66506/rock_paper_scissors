# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This program is a simple command line based game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. You play against the computer in this classic game. The rules are simple - Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock. The first player to score 10 points wins the game.

## How to Run

This program is written in Python 3. You need to have Python 3.x installed on your system to run this program. If you don't have Python installed you can download it from the official site - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To run the game, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension. Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal/command prompt and run the Python file using the command:

```
python3 filename.py
```
Replace `filename.py` with the name of the file you saved the code in.

## How to Play

On running the program, you'll be prompted to enter your name. Following this, you will enter a loop where you can continuously play rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. For each round, you'll be asked to choose Rock (1), Paper (2) or Scissors (3). 

The computer will then randomly make a selection, and the winner of the round is decided. Your score and the computer's score are updated accordingly. If it's a draw, no points are awarded. 

This loop continues until 10 rounds have been played. After that, the overall winner (the one with the higher score) is decided. If you win, a congratulatory message is displayed. If it's a draw, that is also indicated. If the computer wins, a message stating the same is displayed.

After the 10 rounds, you are prompted whether you want to play again. If you choose 'Y', the game restarts. If you choose 'N', the game ends, and a final score is displayed.

Enjoy the game!
